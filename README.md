My personal project that I've been working on since the end of my Senior Year. I started it in Java towards the end of my AP Computer Science class. I didn't touch it again until the first semester of college and I used it as a final and I've been remaking it in different languages throuhgout the semesters as my final project. This is the Python version.

The Monopoly Banker app is a program used to make being the banker in monopoly easier to manage. In the program you can add how many players you want and their names. Once you start the game the banker will be able to set players' balance, add/subtract player balance, buy/sell properties, buy/sell assets, and trade with other players.

Still in progress...
- Want to try to make GUI for this
